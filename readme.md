# Interior Design Agency

**Hi everyone, I am Raushan Kumar**

This project was built as landing page of an Interior Design using only HTML and CSS😎.

>This project taught me the careful use of `positions` and `flexbox` and background image alignment. It was a wonderful project that gave me intense satisfation when was finished😃.

It took around 2 hours to complete the project and there were many intersting hidden properties of CSS that I figured out🤟.


Below is the link and the view of the project👇👇👇<br>
